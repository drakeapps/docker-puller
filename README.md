## Introduction



Due to [the new Docker Hub retention policy](https://www.docker.com/pricing/retentionfaq) a container image that has not been either pushed or pulled from the image repository in 6 or more months will be scheduled for deletion. Only accounts that are on the Free individual or organization plans will be subject to image retention limits.
